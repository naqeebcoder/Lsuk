  <strong>Impartiality:</strong> <br>
        The interpreter  will give equal attention to the service user and service provider. The interpreter  shall be impartial and unbiased. The interpreter is a neutral third party  language conduit and has no role in the decisions taken by the service provider  or client.</p>
      <p><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> <br>
        Anything said in the room is  not to be repeated by the interpreter to any external party. Translators and interpreters  will adhere to data protection regulations and store notes safely on a computer  or on paper to ensure confidentiality.
